OpenDb Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

1) Requirements

To install the Open Media Collectors Database (OpenDb) on your site, you 
will need the following:

- WebServer (Apache 1.3, 2.x, IIS,...) - Apache is recommended, but IIS should work too.

- PHP 4.3.0+, 5.X
  	* track_vars must be enabled.
	* register_globals can be enabled/disabled.
	* php-mysql module must be installed, so that PHP can access MySQL.
		
- MySQL Database 4.X, 5.X

- SMTP server or PHP email configured.  If this is not possible, be sure to 
set the email configuration Mailer to 'none'.

2) Installation / Upgrade

!!WARNING!! - Its extremely important to make a new directory for the 1.X installation
files, do not extract 1.X files over the top of your existing 0.81 installation.

The new installer can be activated by executing install.php.

With appropriate credentials, the OpenDb installer can create the opendb database
and user.

The install.php should be removed from the root directory of the opendb installation once
the install / upgrade process is complete.

2.1) Cover Image Cache (upload/ directory)

When you upgrade from 0.81, if you have any locally saved cover images, you must copy the upload/
directory over to the new 1.X installation, so that cached images can continue to be served.

3) Documentation
	
	Documentation is available from the OpenDb website
		http://opendb.iamvegan.net/

4) Security

Be sure to delete the docs/phpinfo.php file before going live with your site.  This file is 
provided for convenient problem resolution but represents a security risk to leave active.

Be sure to change the configured security hash to avoid potential security issues with CAPTCHA
functionality.
